Entry 1 (10/04/2018)

We started preparing for the requirements gathering phase of the project. The main 2 techniques we've 
decided on are interviews and questionnaires. The process of designing the questionnaires and
the interviews went smoothly, where everyone came to decisions in the wording of them fairly 
quickly. I think as long as we get the formalities of the requirements gathering done, it 
should be easier to get the project started.
