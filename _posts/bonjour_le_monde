Entry 2 (10/09/2018)

The milestone 2 is done. It didn't take us too long to get things done. Only thing that 
lengthened it was having to go back to the things we learnt in Software engineering I.
Creating the use case diagram was a bit of a challenge as well. Figuring out what should be
represented and what should not was a bit difficult for me but we finished it. One thing that
was beneficial was that we've thought on this idea for quite some time so we knew what the 
system would provide readily.
