Entry 6 (10/30/2018)

I struck YouTube tutorial gold. I found a channel that has tutorials on a lot of angular material. The
tutorial I used first was https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fcr-gM-QThc(Getting Started with 
Angular 6 Material (Tutorial)). Angular Material is not very difficult based on my knowledge of Object Oriented
Programming but the pure Angular base is taking some time to understand all of the files and the linkages between
them.
