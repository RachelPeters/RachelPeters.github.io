Entry 5 (10/28/2018)

Okay so we've finally completed the product backlog and equivalent burndown chart. There were 
many moments of "what?", "wait I thought.." and many others. I think it may take some more 
implementations of the agile development process till I feel comfortable with it. Definitely
will need it for the project course so at least it will come to use before I hit the real 
world.
